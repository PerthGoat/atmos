# Atmosphere Simulator

This is a simple atmosphere simulator. It uses a log function to simulate oxygen transfer between tiles and oxygen loss to outer space. Tiles can be WALL, FLOOR, SPACE, and OXYGEN emitter. FLOOR can have oxygen, WALL protects floor from space, and oxygen emitter produces more oxygen to replace lost oxygen.
